//! TLS that trusts an attested public key instead of a certificate authority.
//!
//! The peers here — KMS nodes, the verifier — are TEEs serving self-signed certificates.
//! No CA vouches for them and none should: what a caller checks is that the certificate's
//! public key is the one the peer's attestation committed to, which is a stronger statement
//! than any issuer can make. So this **replaces** certificate-authority validation rather
//! than adding to it.
//!
//! The distinction matters because the obvious alternatives are both wrong. Leaving the
//! default verifier in place fails outright, since nothing will ever chain a self-signed
//! certificate to a root. Reaching for `danger_accept_invalid_certs` makes it connect and
//! checks nothing, which is the hole this exists to close.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* checked: the certificate's name, dates and chain. A name means
//! whatever its issuer decided it means, and there is no issuer. The identity being
//! established is the key, and the key is checked exactly.
